1. Clone the repository using `git clone <repo_url>` and navigate to the repository via terminal
2. Check which branch you are on with `git branch`
3. Switch to your branch with `git checkout <new_branch_name>`
4. Learn more at [git - the simple guide (website)](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
